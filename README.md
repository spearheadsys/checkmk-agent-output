# checkmk-agent-output
A collection of Checkmk agent outputs (snmp or other) from systems and applications that can be used in simulation mode or for development purposes such as extending an existing agent or building a new one. 


# Getting started
Stored agent output allows Checkmk operators to simulate the monitoring of these systems and applications. This is useful for testing, getting to know the systems and applications that are monitored as well as for development purposes.

## Using the stored output
tbd.

* snmp
* agent
* special agent

### using snmp stored walks

### using agent stored output

### using special agent output

## TODO / Other ideas
A simulator that could generate the stored output using random values for certain items would be very nice. We would then get a more "realistic" view of the agents output. One could envision a script that parses and replaces / generates random values based on some format.
